Which registers contain arguments to functions? For example, which register holds 13 in main's call to printf?
a0, a1, a2, a3, a4, a5
a2 hold 13 in main's call to printf

Where is the call to function f in the assembly code for main? Where is the call to g? (Hint: the compiler may inline functions.)
not call function f and g, just let a1 = 12

At what address is the function printf located?
0x0000000000000630

What value is in the register ra just after the jalr to printf in main?
48

Run the following code.

	unsigned int i = 0x00646c72;
	printf("H%x Wo%s", 57616, &i);
      
What is the output? Here's an ASCII table that maps bytes to characters.
The output depends on that fact that the RISC-V is little-endian. If the RISC-V were instead big-endian what would you set i to in order to yield the same output? Would you need to change 57616 to a different value?

Here's a description of little- and big-endian and a more whimsical description.
He110 world		0X72

In the following code, what is going to be printed after 'y='? (note: the answer is not a specific value.) Why does this happen?

	printf("x=%d y=%d", 3);

depend on val in register a2
